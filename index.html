<p class="subtitle">
  The <strong>San Rocco</strong> site, situated near Muggia Bay in the Trieste region, was the most important Roman military fortification in the area during the 2nd to 1st centuries B.C. Based on the typology of amphorae found there, its earliest occupation dates back to the late 3rd or early 2nd century B.C., likely linked to the Second Roman–Histrian War (178 B.C.).

  Featuring exceptionally wide ramparts measuring 20 to 25 meters and a regular internal layout reminiscent of military barracks, San Rocco closely resembles Roman camps from mid-2nd century B.C. Spain. The absence of a ditch and the use of turf, stones, and possibly timber in its walls indicate a temporary yet sturdy military installation. Its strategic location overlooking the Rosandra River and its proximity to a protected harbor support its identification as the main consular camp described by Livy. Due to its size—over 13 hectares—and defensive design, San Rocco is widely considered the probable site of the first Roman Tergeste mentioned by ancient sources like Strabo.
