  <h1>San Rocco</h1>
  <h2>Archaeological Background</h2>
  <p>
    The San Rocco site, located near Muggia Bay in the Trieste area, was the most important Roman military fortification in the region during the 2nd to 1st centuries B.C. Based on the typology of amphorae, its earliest occupation dates back to the late 3rd to early 2nd century B.C., likely associated with the Second Romanâ€“Histrian War (178 B.C.).
